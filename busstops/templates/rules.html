<h1>Vehicle editing rules & FAQ</h1>

<ul class="bulleted">
<li>
    <p><strong>If in doubt, do nothing.</strong> If you find yourself saying "probably", "correct me if I'm wrong", or using the future tense, stop.
        However thrilling it may be to be the first to update this website with new information, be patient and wait until you can <strong>prove</strong>strong> that (for example) a vehicle has been repainted.</p>

<li>
    <p>On the other hand: <strong>it's not your duty to enforce these rules</strong>. Don't be haughty or bumptious. If you can't prove they're wrong, <strong>don't undo someone else's changes</strong>. "Tidying up" isn't a thing â€“ if anything, each edit creates more "mess" in the revision history.</p>

<li>
    <p><strong>Assume good faith.</strong> Before you accuse someone of "spam" or "vandalism", consider whether they've just made a mistake or are medically gormless. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<li>
    <p>Don't try to use the <em>edit vehicle details</em> feature to "message" other users or "the admins". If you must, <a href="/contact">contact bustimes.org</a>.</p>

<li>
    <p>Treat others with respect. Please don't abuse users who approve edits, they are doing the best with the information you supply. If it's declined look at why and find the evidence to back up you're claim.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Proof</h2>

<p>We ask you to provide proof of your edits in a bid to try and keep the site as correct as possible. Providing proof enables your edits to be approved quicker and reduces accusations of false edits.</p>
<h3>Acceptable proof</h3>
<p>Photographs proving what you are saying. You could upload these to another site and provide a link, or if you are struggling, join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gY4PdDFau7">Discord</a> community and upload proof there.</p>

<h3>Unacceptable proof</h3>
<p>Drivers gossip. We love bus drivers but sadly we can't take their word for everything.</p>
<p>Links to private groups or forums. Sadly our moderators will be unlikely to see your wonderful photographs if they are hidden on closed groups or forums</p>
<p>Blindly copying information from other "enthusiast websites".</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why haven't you designed a perfect system for handling edits, voting, moderation etc?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately it's hard, and a distraction from the main job of making a bus tracking and timetable website. I'd quite like to get rid of the whole thing, but it would be a shame to toss away everyone's collective work.</p>

<h3>Can I become an admin?</h3>

<p>There's no such thing! You might as well ask how to become a mermaid.</p>

<h3>How do I add a vehicle?</h3>

<p>You can't. The vehicle lists on bustimes.org are purely a by-product of the automatic vehicle tracking system (the <a href="/map">live map</a> etc.). There are <a href="https://buslists.uk/">other fine websites</a> devoted to listing vehicles for the sake of it.</p>

<h3>I have a different question, or maybe a comment</h3>
