## What's this?

Source code for [the website bustimes.org](https://bustimes.org/).

It's a magnificent monolithic Django app that's evolved over time (since 2015). The structure doesn't make complete sense:

app      | concern
---------|------------
accounts | user accounts
api      | the Django Rest Frameworkâ€“powered API
buses    | contains the site settings.py
busstops | bus stops - but also operating companies, places, and routes ðŸ¤¯ and the site's static file assets
bustimes | getting timetable data out of various formats (GTFS, TransXChange, ATCO-CIF) and into a database and doing stuff therewith
config   | Kamal and Supervisor configuration
departures | listing the "next departures" at a bus stop â€“ from a timetable and/or predicted by an API
disruptions | information about like roadworks, diversions and stuff
fares    | fares
fixtures | some YAML files containing overrides/corrections to the operator (NOC) and bus stop (NaPTAN) datasets. Also recorded HTTP responses used in tests
frontend | TypeScript and Sass bits
transxchange | code for parsing TransXChange XML files. Could be published as a separate package
vehicles | tracking buses' locations and showing them on a map, and pointless details about vehicles' colours and features
vosa     | the Great Britain Traffic Commissioners' bus service registration data. VOSA is the name of a defunct UK government agency.

This documentation is incomplete and out of date.
And that's OK (?) because I don't expect anyone to need to follow it.
I will try to document some things for my own reference.

## Installing

### Using Docker Compose

```
docker compose up
```

Then head to http://localhost:8000

```
npm run watch
```

### Using local install

These need to be available:

- Python 3.12
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install necessary Python packages (Django, etc)
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS
    - On my Macintosh computer I use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)
- `npm` to install some front end JavaScript things
- Redis 6.2+
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)

Some environment variables need to be set.
Many of them control settings in [buses/settings.py](buses/settings.py).

```bash
DEBUG=1
SECRET_KEY=blablabla
DATABASE_URL=postgis://user:password@host/database-name
```

Then run these commands:

```bash
npm install
poetry install --with dev --with test  # install Python dependencies including special ones for development and testing
poetry run ./manage.py migrate  # create database tables
poetry run ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000  # run the Django development server (not suitable for production, use gunicorn for that!)
```

[.github/workflows/test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml) sort of documents the process of installing dependencies and running tests.

## Importing data

### Static data (stops, timetables, etc)

```bash
poetry run ./import.sh
```
will download *some* data from various [sources](https://bustimes.org/data) and run the necessary Django [management commands](busstops/management/commands) to import it,
in a sensible order (place names, then stops, then timetables).
When run repeatedly, it will only download and import the stuff that's changed.
It needs a username and password for the Traveline National Dataset step.

But then there are further management commands for getting further data from further places like the Bus Open Data Service.

### Live data

Some "live" data â€“ departure times at stops, and vehicle locations â€“ is/are fetched as and when a user accesses a page.

For the rest, there are some Django management commands that need to be run indefinitely in the background.
These update [the big map of bus locations](https://bustimes.org/map), etc.
I use supervisord (see [config/supervisor.conf](config/supervisor.conf)).

## Deploying

Uses Kamal (see [config/deploy.yml](config/deploy.yml))
